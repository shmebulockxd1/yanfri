# Override config options for players with these permissions, "graves.permission.{name}".
# If a player has multiple permissions, options are selected from the top down.
# For example, if a player has both admin and vip permissions, the admin settings will override the vip settings
# because admin is listed first. Place the highest permission groups at the top to ensure correct hierarchy and avoid
# redundancy in defining settings for each group.
# Remember you can copy options from the default section.
